### Project Topic: Simplified `du` Utility

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Rust that calculates and displays the disk usage of a given directory.

#### Core Functionality:
- Recursively traverses a specified directory and all its subdirectories.
- Sums up the size of all files within the directory tree.
- Displays the total size in bytes.

This project tackles a fundamental "systems" problem by interacting directly with the file system, handling paths, and managing I/O operations, all while leveraging Rust's ownership and borrowing concepts for safe and efficient memory management.
